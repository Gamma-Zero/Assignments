Background Music: Kaine/Escape from NieR Replicant (Keiichi Okabe)
In case of 2 enemies at the same spot and the player kills one of them, the other one gets hidden behind the box. Needs to be fixed.
In case of multiple enemy deaths at the same spot, the user only gets a single box. May need to change that.
